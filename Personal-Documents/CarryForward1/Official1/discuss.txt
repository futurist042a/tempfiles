Hi Dakota

I am in this tough situation currently.

What happened was that when I started on my current job, I was given targets to implement Enterprise Strategies, TOS 2020, build new things, change the way we do things. I felt excited to take-on these goals. However when I tried to collaborate with DEV team, dev managers to discuss what more we can do or go over suggestions like how we can improve on what we do currently and deliver more in an agile fashion, I felt that teams are so busy with current project work that they like to avoid going through all this and they just want to stick to their current project work. I felt that I am becoming more of a hinderance in this regard. People had difficulty realizing small pain of today can be a big comfort for tomorrow, reusable components today less cost to bank tomorrow. 

Also you will agree with me on this, that change in culture has inherent disruption associated with it. However my expectation was that my management will support me in all this especially they gave me these goals. However I started receiving mixed messages from top, like don’t try to be a leader, some developers are not happy, I was not able to get time from management to go over strategies and most of it I was doing standalone, some time I was fully stopped and was asked to just stick to project work. However my goals continue to be set as Tos2020, implement enterprise strategies etc.

Things turned really bad for me when I switched to my current manager 2 months ago. I was being humiliated and disrespected periodically, even during the meetings. So I decided to setup a skip level meeting. However during the skip level meeting I was told that things will get better if I move to Richfield, Minnesota. In fact, I was told that I can’t function as an Architect in my current role anymore working remotely from Chicago. But I can’t move to Richfield, I am fully settled in Chicago and frankly I am not sure at all that things will get better if I move to Richfield. The only way out given to me is that from now on, I need to start travelling every week to Richfield and travelling expenses will be out of my pocket. This will have significant toll on my health and I have to spend about $2000 every month on travelling. I don’t have that kind of money and I don’t know how long I can survive like this.

I will request you to guide me and help situate me to a better role within US Bank. You have some experience with me so you may have an idea about me. Job as given below seemed a good fit for me, but I was never contacted by recruiter, may be you can help there as well.

I am so sorry for the trouble!

Hi Dakota

I see a job opportunity within US Bank titled as “Distinguished Engineer - Minneapolis, MN-190025335”. Primary location for this job is Minneapolis, however they are accepting applicants from any location. I have applied for this job few days ago, but haven’t heard back from anybody on this. 

After going  through the Job Description, I felt excited and very much related to this job. I feel I will be better situated with this job and will be accommodated/appreciated if I contribute in IIR program with ideas like OneBridge and Personal Accountant.

I think this job is part of Experience Studios at US Bank. Experience Studios introduction is given within Job Description.

If you like the idea, then I will be grateful for any help given in this regard. If it seems appropriate to you and if you know somebody who is part of the management group who offered this job then maybe you can refer me to him. Thank you very much.

Please see attached the JOB Description and then my cover letter for the JOB and Resume. Thanks again.

I was not getting credits for my work and I felt there are some insecurities, some ego issues. I am a doer, I was not ready and nor positioned to deal with political environment. I was really looking for support from management, some appreciation, bucking me up. Instead I felt being discarded.
